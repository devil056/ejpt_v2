- In certain cases, exploit code will be developed in C/C++/C#, as a result, you will need to compile the exploit code in to a PE (Portable Executable) or binary.
- Cross compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform other than the one performing the compilation
- As a penetration tester, you will need to have the skills necessary to compile exploit code developed in C.
- Compiling code in C for 64bit system command : `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploit.c> -o <output-file-name>` and for the 32 bit version it is the same with an added tag : `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploit.c> -o <output-file-name> -lws2_32`
- Command to compile a code for linux system execution `gcc -pthread <exploit.c> -o <output-file> -lcrypt`
