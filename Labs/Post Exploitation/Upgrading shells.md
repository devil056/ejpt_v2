- It is the same lab environment that we exploited in the file sharing for the linux part so please try to exploit the system and once you have got access to the non-interactive shell come back here. And the way we can confirm that it is an non interactive shell is that we will not be getting anything on screen and we can try to run some commands and so far in the course we tried to launch a bash session using the command `/bin/bash -i`  which is more stable compared to normal session.
- We are running the command under the assumption that the bash shell is installed on the system that might not be the case all the time chances are that it might have been replaced with a bourne shell or zshell as well at times.
- In that case it would be better if we are to check the type of shells that are available on the target system and try to launch the one that we are most comfortable with. That can be done concatenating shells file `cat /etc/shells` 
- The other way to launch a shell is to find the version of the python that is available on the system using python we can obtain a bash session.
	- `python --version` to check the version of python
	- `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to launch a bash session in the non interactive shell session
- Incase if there is no python but perl is available 
	- `perl --help` to check the version of the perl that is installed on target system.
	- `perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'` to launch a shell
- If ruby is installed
	- `ruby:  exec "/bin/bash"` to launch a bash shell using ruby
- Once we have obtained an interactive shell we need to check the environment variables and that can be done using the command `env` incase there is no path variable is specified we need to specify the path using the command `export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` and check once again
- Also we can set the term variable using the command `export TERM=xterm`
- Setting the shell `export SHELL=bash`

Even with all these setting we do not have the job control and that will be covered down the line. Now that the variables are in place we will be able to run the commands that we want without issues to some extent.
