What is vulnerability scanning ?

- Vulnerability scanning and detection is the process of scanning a target for vulnerabilities and verifying whether they can be exploited.
- So far, we have been able to identify and exploit misonfigurations on target systems, however, in this section we will be exploring the process of utilizing auxiliary and exploit modules to scan and identify inherent vulnerabilities in services, operating systems and web applications.
- This information will come in handy during the exploitation phase of this course.
- We will also be exploring the process of utilizing third party vulnerability scanning tools like Nessus and how we can integrate Nessus functionality in to the MSF.
- For the purposes of demonstrating the vulnerability scanning process, we will be utilizing an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine called Metasploitable3 that is based on Widows server 2008.
- Metasploitable3 was developed by Rapid7 to demonstrate how MSF can be used to perform exploitation of a windows system.
- Intructions on how this VM can be setup can be found here : [Metasploitable3](https://bit.ly/3kASwns) [Autopwn](https://github.com/hahwul/metasploit-autopwn)

`db_import` to import the nmap scans and nessus scan results.
`vulns -p 445` to limit the vulnerabilities to a specific port or service.
