- Pivoting is a post exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host that is connected to multiple networks to gain access to systems within other networks.
- After gaining access to one host, we can use the compromised host to exploit other hosts on a private internal network to which we could not access previously
- Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal networks subnet, perform port forwarding and consequently scan and exploit other systems on the network.

Port forwarding

- Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system
- In the context of pivoting, we can forward a remote port on a previously inaccessile host to a local port on our Kali Linux System so that we can remotely interact/exlploit the service running on the port
