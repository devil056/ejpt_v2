- Post exploitation refers to the actions performed on the target system after initial access has been obtained.
- The post exploitation phase of a penetration test consists of various techniques like
	- Local Enumeration
	- Privilege Escalation
	- Dumping Hashes
	- Establishing Persistence
	- Clearing your tracks
	- Pivoting

Meterpreter
- The Meterpreter (Meta-Interpreter) payload is an advanced multi-functional payload that operates via DLL injection and is executed in memory on the target system, consequently making it difficult to detect.
- It communicates over a stager socket and provides an attacker with an interactive command interpreter on the target system that facilitates the execution of system commands, file system navigation, keyloggin and much more.
- Meterpreter also allows us to load custom script and plugins dynamically.
- MSF provides us with various types of meterpreter payloads that can be used based on the target environment and the OS architecture.
