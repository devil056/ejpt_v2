Privilege escalation through Weak permissions

- `whoami` , `cat /etc/passwd` , `cat /etc/group` , `groups student` 
- We will use the find command to search for files with weak permissions learn about the find command
- We can see that we are allowed to view the /etc/shadow file which contains all the hashes passwords of all users so what we can do is change the password of the root user to our own password and use it to login as root.
- The shadow file saves the password in encrypted format
- `openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password` this is the command to generate the password in hash format and the password is `password` replace the \* in root with the hash that we got from the openssl command
- `su` and type the password once you enter the password you will be able to get the root privileges.

Sudo privileges

- In this lab we already do have access to an unprivileged user account in the system. We can directly go ahead and perform the local enumeration, by checking the other user accounts in the system using the command `cat /etc/passwd`
- To see the commands that we are able to run with sudo permissions use the command `sudo -l` and we can see that we are able to run the manpages binary 
- If we are to put in terms of Windows operating system it means that we are able to run a program as administrator even when the user is not a part of the Administrators group without providing a password.
- So it means that we can run the man commands without providing the password. So it does not make any difference if we run the command like `sudo man ls` or `man ls`
- We do have an exception in here that we can spawn a bash shell from within the man pages using the `!/bin/bash` as we are executing the shell as root user we will be able to obtain the session with the sudo privileges.
