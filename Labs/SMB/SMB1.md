Questions:
1. Find the default tcp ports used by smbd.
2. Find the default udp ports used by nmbd.
3. What is the workgroup name of samba server?
4. Find the exact version of samba server by using appropriate nmap script.
5. Find the exact version of samba server by using smb_version metasploit module.
6. What is the NetBIOS computer name of samba server? Use appropriate nmap scripts.
7. Find the NetBIOS computer name of samba server using nmblookup
8. Using smbclient determine whether anonymous connection (null session)Â  is allowed on the samba server or not.
9. Using rpcclient determine whether anonymous connection (null session) is allowed on the samba server or not.
