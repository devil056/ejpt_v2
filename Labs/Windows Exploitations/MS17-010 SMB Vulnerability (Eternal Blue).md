- EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144) is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
- The EternalBlue exploit was developed by the NSA (National Security Agency) to take advantage of the MS17-010 vulnerability and was leaked to the public by a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers in 2017.
- The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.
- With the EternalBlue we will by default get the Elevated priviliges.
- The EternalBlue exploit was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack on June 27,2017 to exploit other Windows systems across networks with the objective of spreading the ransomware to as many systems as possible.
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows
	- Windows Vista
	- Windows 7
	- Windows server 2008
	- Windows 8.1
	- Windows server 2012
	- Windows 10
	- Windows server 2016
- Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March 2017, however many users and companies have still not yet patched their systems
- The EternalBlue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system is vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
- The EternalBlue exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerability windows systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on the target system.
- In addition to MSF modules, we can also manually exploit the vulnerability by utilizing publicly available exploit code.
