- Powershell-Empire (Empire) is a pure PowerShell exploitation/post exploitation framework build on cryptological-secure communications and flexible architecture.
- Empire implements the ability to run powershell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post exploitation modules ranging from keyloggers to mimikatz and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability focused framework
- Powershell empire recently received an update and is now officially support and maintained by Kali Linux, more information regarding the update can be found in : https://www.kali.org/blog/empire-starkiller/

Starkiller

- In addition to being updated and modernized, BC Security, the company responsible for maintaining the Empire has also developed a companion to Empire called Starkiller.
- Starkiller is a GUI frontend for the powershell empire. It is an Electron application written in VueJS and provides users with an intuitive way of interacting with empire.
- In order to get an understanding of how Empire works and the components that make up the framework, I would recommend going through the official documentation which can be found in : https://www.powershellempire.com/
- Powershell-Empire & Starkiller are both available as packages in the Kali Linux repositories.
- Command to install powershell empire : `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install powershell-empire`
- Once done with the installation we need to start the backend server of the powershell empire : `sudo powershell-empire server` once the server is up and running we can run the client using the command `sudo powershell-empire client` and the username to login to the client interface `empireadmin` and password is `password123`
- Plugins -- Our main job would be with listeners and stager generation.
