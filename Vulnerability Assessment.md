### Vulnerability assessment

What is a vulnerability?

A weakness in the computational login (e.g code ) found in the software and the hardware components that when exploited results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity or availability. 
The vulnerability might come from a software or operating system like a feature that is inbuilt in operating system. It might also come from a software installed by the user.

The U.S govt. has a national cybersecurity federally funded and research development center for CVE's. The CVE (Common vulnerabilities and exposure) website managed by MITRE corp funded by National Cybersecurity divison dept of US. 
NIST maintains National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

CVE have identifiers:
They called across as 
	+ CVE names
	+ CVE numbers
	+ CVE-IDs
	+ CVEs

E.g.
CVE-2021-44228 --> Log4J [LINK-CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) [LINK-NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
CVE-2014-0160 --> Heartbleed
CVE-2017-0143 --> Eternalblue (ms17010)

Zero Day --> All the vulnerabilities we looked at till now are reported to authorities. There are some vulnerabilities that are not reported to the authorities till now we call them as Zero day vulnerabilities. No one has reported them till now to CVE authorities. Not all vuln are computer code some are based on social networking. Password social engineering and all. Card readers, access badges and so on. Layer 8 we can like copy the badge and tail gate and get to physical network.
