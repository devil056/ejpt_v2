- A Black box penetration test is a security assessment whereby the penetration tester is not provided with any information regarding the target system or network (No IP ranges, system information or default credentials are provided)
- The objective of a black box penetration test is to accurately test the security of a system or network as an external unprivileged adversary
- This approach is very useful as it demonstrates how an external attacker with no inside knowledge would compromise a company's systems or networks

Penetration testing phases:
- Information gathering
- Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Post exploitation
	- Privilege escalation
	- Maintaining Persistant Access
	- Clearing tracks

Black Box Methodology:
- Host discovery
- Port scanning and enumeration
- Vulnerability detection/scanning
- Exploitation
	- Manual
	- Automated
- Post exploitation
	- Privilege escalation
	- Persistence
	- Dumping hashes


Scenario and scope:
- You have just begun your first jobs as a Junior Penetration Tester and have been assigned to assist in performing a penetration test on a client's network
- The pentest lead has assigned you to gain access/exploit a host running Windows server 2008
- Your primary objectives are:
	- Identify the services running on the target
	- Identify vulnerabilities with the services that are running on the target
	- Exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain an initial foothold
Note: You are permitted to use the Metasploit Framework.

Stage 1 : Scanning and enumeration

- The target IP was not provided and so on checking the hosts file we got the IP address : 10.5.26.153
- And ping was successful to the target IP as well
- Running basic nmap scan with no timing flag and top 10000 port and finally all ports scan with an output that we can import into MSFConsole.

Stage 2 : Targeting the Microsoft IIS FTP

- Check for the FTP version and using the nmap ftp-anon script to check if the anonymous login is allowed.
- If the anonymous login is not allowed try to brute force using the hydra or different tool and get a password.
- Incase if you find a password try to login to the service and upload a payload .aspx and check if you are able to get reverse connection
- If you fail to get a reverse connection try to deface the website documents.

Stage 3 : Targeting Openssh

- NMAP and hydra
