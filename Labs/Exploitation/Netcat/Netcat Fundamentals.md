- Netcat (TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife) is a networking utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP
- Netcat is available for both \*Nix and Windows operating systems, consequently making it extremely useful for cross-platform engagements.
- Netcat utilizes a client-server communication architecture with two modes:
	- Client mode - Netcat can be used in client mode to connect to any TCP/UDP port as well as a Netcat listener (server)
	- Server mode - Netcat can be used to listen for connections from clients on a specific port.
- Netcat can be used by penetration testers to perform the following funcationality:
	- Banner grabbing
	- Port scanning
	- Transferring files
	- Bind/Reverse Shells
- In order for the windows to run the server we need to transfer the nc.exe (netcat executable) on to the target system.

In order for us to set up a server we can start the nc server with the command `nc -nlvp <port>` and to connect to the host `nc -nv <host-ip> <port>`
and incase if we are to use the UDP port `nc -nlvup <port>` to connect we use the command `nc -nvu <host ip> <port>`
to share a file using the netcat create a file and `nc -nlvp <port> < <file.file_ext>` and to save the file `nc -nv <host> <port> > file.file_ext`

Bind Shells

- A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system
- A netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like cmd.exe or /bin/bash when a client connects to the listener

Reverse shells

- A reverse shell is a type of remote shell where the target connects directly to a listener on the attacker system, consequently allowing for the execution of commands on the target system. In this case we do not need to have the nc on the target system.
- The execution of the reverse shell is more successful compared to the bind shell due the reason that the inbound traffic will be monitored where are the chances of the outgoing traffic is not monitored.
- The downside of this reverse shell is that inorder to establish the reverse connection the IP attacker IP address is saved on the target machine.
- We can generate the reverse shell using the resources [GitHub CheatSheet](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) [Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)
