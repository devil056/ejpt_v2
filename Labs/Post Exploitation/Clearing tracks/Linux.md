Lab details:

- Target IP is adjacent IP address in the very same network
- Perform a nmap service versioning scan
- We can see that the target is running a Samba
- Using the metasploit framework to use the available module to exploit the target set the global rhosts value to the target value
- use the module exploit/linux/samba/is_known_pipename
- We get a non interactive shell we can make it more interactive using the `/bin/bash -i`
- When ever we are uploading files to the linux system make sure to upload in the tmp directory which is at the root of the file system. By default all the files in the directory will be deleted upon reboot.
- As we have already noticed we know that the metasploit framework generates alot of artifacts so we need to make sure to keep an eye on the location of the artifacts when it comes to the linux system as we do not have many resource scripts to clean them up
- Also at the home directory we can see that there is a .bashrc file present along with the .bashrc_history file which saves up all the commands that are run previously
- You can simply use the `history` command to list the command that you have used in that particular session incase if the .bashrc_hostory is not active
- Instead of deleting the complete bash history remove the commands that would otherwise indicate the system is compromised
- That being said you can clear the history of the commands using the other command `history -c`
- `cat /dev/null > .bash_history`
