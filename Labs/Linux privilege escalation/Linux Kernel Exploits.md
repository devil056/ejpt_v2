- Kernel exploits on Linux will typically target vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell
- This process will differ based on the Kernel version and distribution being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.
- Privilege escalation on Linux systems will typically follow the following methodology
	- Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
	- Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system
- Linux exploit suggester - This tool is designed to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given Linux kernel/Linux-based machine. It assesses (using heuristics methods) the exposure of the given kernel on every publicly known Linux kernel exploit
	- Github: https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester
Note: The techniques demonstrated in this video are performed on an Ubuntu 12.04 VM

Once you have gained the meterpreter session to the target try to upload the linux-exploit-suggester. And once the script is uploaded get into the shell session :
- Modify the permission of the script uploaded to executable
- Run the script to obtain the suggestions

When it comes to kernel exploit the most important key information is
- Kernel Version
- Architecture
- Distribution
- Distribution Version

- The ones listed at the top are the ones that will most probably work. In this case it is `dirtycow` exploit.
- You can refer to the exploit using the link provided and use the code from the repo to be downloaded on to your attack machine.
- Once it is downloaded upload it to the target system the same way we did with the exploit-suggester.
- We can compile the c code as per the instructions provided in the exploit and run the executable file.

Finally we managed to elevate the privileges of the system through a new user account that we created with the exploit that we just managed to run.
