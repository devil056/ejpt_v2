- Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system
- Privilege escalation is a vital element of the attack life cycle and is a majpt deteminant in the overall success of a penetration test.
- After gaining an initial foothold on a target system you will be required to elevate your privileges in order to perform tasks and functionality that require administrative privileges.
- The importance of privilege escalation in the penetration testing process cannot be overstated or overlooked. Developing your privilege escalation skills will mark you out as a good penetration tester.


#### Windows Kernel

- A kernel is a computer program that is the core of an operating system and has complete control over every resource and hardware on a system. It acts as a translation layer between the hardware and software and facilitates the communication between these two layers.
- Windows NT is the kernel that comes pre packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user design philosophy. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources and hardware:
	- User Mode - Programs and services running in user mode have limited access to system resources and functionality
	- Kernel Mode - Kernel mode has unrestricted access to system resources and functionality of managing devices and system memory.
- Kernel exploits on Windows will typically target vulnerabilities in the windows kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.
- This process will differ based on the version of windows being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.
- Privilege escalation on Windows systems will typically follow the following methodology
	- Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
	- Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system.
- Windows Exploit suggester - this tool compares a targets patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins.
