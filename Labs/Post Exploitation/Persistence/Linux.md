Persistence via SSH:

- Linux is typically deployed as a server operating system and as a result, Linux servers are typically accessed remotely via services/protocols such as SSH.
- If SSH is enabled and running on a Linux system you have compromised, you can take advantage of the SSH configuration to establish persistent access on the target system.
- In most cases Linux servers will have key-based authentication enabled for the SSH service, allowing the users to access the Linux system remotely without the need for a password.
- After gaining the access to a Linux system, we can transfer the SSH private key of a specific user account to our system and use that SSH private key for all the future authentication and access
