- It is kali GUI based lab
- Target IP is adjacent to our IP address open the burpsuite
- Start a temporary project and then turn on the Foxy proxy in the browser so that we can bypass the requests
- From the proxy tab see the request and in order to modify the request you need to select the actions and then forward the request to the intruder so we can modify certain values
- In the Intruder tab we are supposed to set the target in the first tab
- In the second tab select the placement of the word we wish to check and then the type of the attack
- In the third payload tab we are to manually eneter the words we wish to check or simply laod the common words in the txt file as well and start the attack
- Once we got all the response codes we can filter them or simply check the responses and plan our next move
