#### dnsrecon

```
DNSRecon is a Python port of a Ruby script that I wrote to learn the language and about DNS in early 2007. This time I wanted to learn about Python and extend the functionality of the original tool and in the process re-learn how DNS works and how could it be used in the process of a security assessment and network troubleshooting.

usage: dnsrecon [-h] [-d DOMAIN] [-n NS_SERVER] [-r RANGE] [-D DICTIONARY] [-f] [-a] [-s] [-b] [-y] [-k] [-w] [-z] [--threads THREADS] [--lifetime LIFETIME] [--tcp] [--db DB] [-x XML] [-c CSV] [-j JSON] [--iw]
                [--disable_check_recursion] [--disable_check_bindversion] [-V] [-v] [-t TYPE]
```
