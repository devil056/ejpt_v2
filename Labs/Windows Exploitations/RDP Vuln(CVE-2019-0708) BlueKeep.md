### CVE-2019-0708 BlueKeep

- BlueKeep(CVE-2019-0708) is the name given to an RDP vulnerability in Windows that could potentially allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
- The BlueKeep vulnerability was made public by Microsoft in May 2019.
- The BlueKeep exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the windows RDP protocol that allows attackers to gain access to a chunk of kernel memory consequently allowing them to remotely execute arbitrary code at the system level without authentication.
- Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability on May 14 2019 and has urged companies to patch this vulnerability as soon as possible.
- At the time of discovery, about 1 million systems worldwide were found to be vulnerable
- The bluekeep vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows
	- Xp
	- Vista
	- Windows 7
	- Windows server 2008 & R2
- The Bluekeep vulnerability has varios illegitimate PcC's and exploit code that could be malicious in nature. It is therefore recommended to only utilize verified exploit code and modules for exploitation
- The BlueKeep exploit has an MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system if vulnerable to exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
- The BlueKeep exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerable windows systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on the target system.

Note: Targeting kernel space memory and applications can cause system crashes.
